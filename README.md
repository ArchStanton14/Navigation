# Navigation
A tool to help navigate indoor spaces

Will read CSV to create a virtual map; use multi-level weighted graph objects to navigate through it, and later come up with some kind of graphical representation of this.

Use giant hashmap of rooms and locations to find where to route to

Create nesting template to give routes 

Hall: Buildings have Hall: Floors with Hall: Halls
Each object tells you how to get to the sub object


might wait for chapter on trees for this one
